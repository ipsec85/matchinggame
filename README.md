## Description

This app allows players to take turns picking two cards at a time and see if they match. If they do, the cards remain face up. If they do not, after a second, the cards flip back over. This allows the player enough time to remember the images and then continue play. With each attempt, a turn counter increments by 1. Players have unlimited turns to match all cards. At anytime, either when all cards have been matched or not, a player can choose to start a new game which then reshuffles all cards.

The app uses React to achieve game play. I choose React because it is the first major JavaScript framework I've decided to learn. Utilizing a component approach to developing a game like this was good practice at learning the basics of React such as useState, useEffect, props, amongst other features.
